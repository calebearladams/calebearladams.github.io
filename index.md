I am a second year PhD student in the Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences, Jackson School of Geosciences at the University of Texas at Austin where I am advised by Dr. Ashley M. Matheny and Dr. Dev Niyogi. I received my BS in Computational and Applied Mathematics from Western New Mexico University in 2022. I'm a recipient of the Department of Energy Computational Science Fellowship and the Donald D. Harrington Fellowship. My research interests are in the use of numerical modeling and other computational methods to study fire and ecohydrology.
